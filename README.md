<h1> Pymaceuticals: Drug Data Analysis</h1>


<h3>SUMMARY FINDINGS:</h3>

Based on the analysis of the data contained in this notebook, we have found that the two drugs that appear to be the safest and provide the best results are Capomulin and Ramicane. These mice had longer life spans across the span of the study, and they also had smaller tumor sizes at the time of the final timepoint measurement. More studies should be designed for these two drugs in particular.

While not a direct observation on the drug results, we also saw the correlation between the weight of the mice themselves, and the sizes of the tumors they suffered. Perhaps more studies should be designed to find definitive results on this idea.

Alarmingly, mice on any drug other than Capomulin and Ramicane performed at around the same level as mice on the Placebo, except for mice on Propriva which lived the shortest in the study on average.
